You can subscribe using RSS or email, as described below.

## RSS

My site provides an [RSS feed](/index.xml) to which you can subscribe in your RSS reader of choice. If you aren't familiar with RSS, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Wikipedia also has a large [list of RSS reader applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators) (although it's missing my personal favorite, [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/)).

## Email

If you'd prefer to get an email when I post new content, you can email me at [hi@jasoncarloscox.com](mailto:hi@jasoncarloscox.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20subscribe!) and ask to subscribe. Once you're subscribed, I'll personally email you whenever there's new content -- very high-tech, I know.

I won't share your email address with anyone, and you can unsubscribe anytime by sending me another email.

If you don't want to give me your email address but still want email updates, you can use a service like [FeedRabbit](https://feedrabbit.com/?url=https://jasoncarloscox.com/index.xml) to be notified when my RSS feed updates.
