summary: A stand for my Kyria keyboard that allows me to use it tented 90Â° and is also a case.

One of the reasons I built my [Kyria keyboard](/creations/kyria), which has two separate halves, was to allow me to tent the halves to a more comfortable angle for my hands. The keyboard has tripod mounts on the bottom of each side, and I tried using those for tenting, but I found that it wasn't super stable with large amounts of tilt; I was shooting for nearly vertical. Eventually I decided to use a cardboard box and some velcro to solve my problems.

I used a rather sturdy box that I had left over from something I bought online. It was about the right size to separate the two keyboard halves a decent distance, and it happened to fit them inside as well, so I could use it as a case when transporting the keyboard. I bought some fancy low-profile velcro, attached one half to the keyboard and the other half to the box, and voilÃ !

My contraption worked well for keeping the keyboard vertical, but the bottom of the box was too slippery against the desk, causing the whole thing to move side to side when I typed. I was about to just velcro it to the desk until I thought of a more portable solution -- adding some sort of non-slip covering to the bottom of the box. I found an old mouse pad and taped it on, and the slipping problems were solved.

With everything ready, I started using my vertical keyboard. ~~Everything worked as intended, except for one small detail -- it wasn't comfortable! I tried moving things around for quite a while and eventually concluded that with my hands turned vertically, my thumbs did not like having their keys on the same plane as the finger keys. Along the way I also discovered that having the keys at a different height/depth for each finger would be more comfortable. Basically I realized that what I wanted was something like the [Dactyl ManuForm keyboard](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform). Maybe someday I'll build one...~~

~~I won't be using my new creation much, but it was fun to build nevertheless. On to the next project!~~

A few weeks later, I've given this whole contraption another shot, and I'm liking it this time around! I'm not really sure what changed ðŸ¤· I still think a ManuForm-style keyboard would be even better, but for now my makeshift vertical Kyria is working pretty well.
