summary: Theme for Grav CMS that powered my old portfolio website. This was one of my favorite projects because other people actually used it; I loved getting an occasional email thanking me for the theme or asking for help getting it working. (I've since moved on from Grav for simplicity's sake, but I'm still happy to help existing users! I'd also love to find a new maintainer -- [email me](mailto:hi@jasoncarloscox.com).)
