I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu), where I work with [Dr. Ellen Zegura](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/ellen-zegura) in the Computing and Society Lab.

My primary interests are **computer networking** and **computing for social good**. Currently, I'm focusing on finding ways to measure and improve Internet access for underserved groups. Check out my projects below to learn more.
