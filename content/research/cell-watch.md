CellWatch is an Android app for collecting network performance measurements. We're building the app to be compliant with the FCC's challenge process so that consumers can use it to prove that they don't have sufficient cellular coverage. In the long-term, we also hope to include diverse measurement capabilities in the app so that it will be useful to a wide range of networking researchers.
