To understand where cellular coverage is insufficient, we need connectivity and performance measurements collected from real cellular devices in the wild. However, collecting such measurements is time consuming. As a result, we're using existing datasets -- such as the FCC's mobile coverage data, Ookla's mobile performance data, and OpenStreetMap's maps -- to assess the value and cost of collecting additional measurements in a given area. This data is then used to plan routes that maximize the value of the measurements collected while minimizing the cost to collect them.
