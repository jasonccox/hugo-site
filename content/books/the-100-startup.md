I loved this book's focus on "microbusinesses" -- it's full of stories of people who started businesses with little to no outside investment and intentionally kept them small. Some of the stories lacked detail, but for the most part, they got the point across. Reading <cite>The $100 Startup</cite> got me excited about some business ideas of my own and helped me think through them -- I would definitely recommend it to anyone hoping to start a small business.
