The first few chapters of this book were fun, interesting explorations of the way we deal with human-nature conflicts. However, I started losing interest as Roach shifted from discussing how we deal with these conflicts to merely writing about their occurrence. Around the same time, her writing style, although initially enjoyable, began to wear on me -- a few jokes are funny, but after too many, the humor feels forced. Perhaps <cite>Fuzz</cite> would be better enjoyed by reading a chapter here and there over several weeks.
