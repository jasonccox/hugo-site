What an incredible story! I am appalled at the tragic way in which Alabama's legislative system failed Hinton, but his hopeful perspective and willingness to forgive amaze me; despite having spent 30 years of his life wrongfully imprisoned on death row, Hinton tells his story without animosity. He also communicates an important message about the value of every life. I had never seriously considered the death penalty before, but Hinton's story provides moving evidence that an imperfect justice system has no business killing anyone and that even the most vicious criminals can change.
