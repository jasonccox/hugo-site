I thoroughly enjoyed <cite>Range</cite>. Epstein does a great job explaining why, in a world that seems to encourage everyone to specialize, generalized experience is still essential. He doesn't attack specialization, but rather defends generalization, arguing that a breadth of knowledge is a prerequisite to creativity and innovation.
