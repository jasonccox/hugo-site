This was a well-written book about an impressive woman. I was amazed by Elizabeth Packard's perseverance and bravery, and Moore told her story in a suspenseful, engaging way. Overall, <cite>The Woman They Could Not Silence</cite> was a refreshing dose of positivity, reminding me that a single determined person can make a big difference in a short period of time.
