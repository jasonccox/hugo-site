I chose this book hoping that it would shed some light on how to improve the plight of people like my 107-year-old great grandmother, who still lives at home thanks to help from nearby family members but who seems rather depressed by her deteriorating life; I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. Gawande makes a compelling case, arguing that our end-of-life care systems are too focused on making life longer rather than on making our final years better. I found <cite>Being Mortal</cite> quite interesting, and I hope I can convince my loved ones to read it and plan for their futures as they age.
