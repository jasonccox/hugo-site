This book was full of interesting stories and valuable insights -- that humans naturally assume others are truthful (and that's a good thing), for example, or that divining how someone feels/thinks without knowing them well is nearly impossible. However, the book did not feel particularly cohesive to me; it wasn't always clear what point Gladwell was trying to make, and some of the stories didn't really seem to fit. I enjoyed reading <cite>Talking to Strangers</cite>, but it didn't contain much of the practical advice for interacting with others that I'd hoped for.
