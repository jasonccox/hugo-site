It's both exciting and alarming to discover that you (and everyone, really) have a totally distorted view of the world. That's the experience I had reading this book. Rosling does a great job of pointing out humans' fundamental perspective problems in a hopeful, inspiring way. I'd say that <cite>Factfulness</cite> should be required reading for everyone everywhere.
