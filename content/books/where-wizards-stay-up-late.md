Reading about the early history of the Internet -- from the origins of the ARPANET in the 1960s until it was decommissioned in 1990 -- was fascinating. It's amazing to realize that even the people who built the foundation of the Internet had no idea what it would become. I was also struck by the way ARPA functioned -- it had lots of government funding and almost as much freedom to choose its research directions -- and by the persistence required for each innovation that led to the Internet of today. All in all, <cite>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</cite> was an interesting, inspiring read.
