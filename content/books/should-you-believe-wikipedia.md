I found this book's take on how we interact online refreshingly constructive. (Despite its somewhat misleading name, the book is about online communities in general, not just Wikipedia.) Portraying online communities as a useful supplement to our in-person communities, Bruckman analyzes the benefits and difficulties of connecting over the Internet and gives thoughtful suggestions for ensuring that the Internet is a force for good.

I found the section about online collaboration particularly interesting; she encourages readers to find ways to get involved with "peer production" such as contributing to Wikipedia, citizen science, or open source software projects. I also enjoyed her exploration of the effects that business models have on the Internet, and I agree with her conclusion that we need more non-profit online communities because financial incentives and the incentives of users/society are often at odds with each other.
