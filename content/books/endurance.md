This is the kind of story that seems so crazy it can't possibly be true, but it is. I was amazed that Shackleton and his crew managed to survive months on the Antarctic ice pack, two journeys in tiny boats on the open ocean, crossing a never-before-crossed island, and more. Lansing did a great job telling this remarkable story.
