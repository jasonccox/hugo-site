I had a wonderful time reading this book. It was interesting, insightful, and compelling, and despite its ominous take on the attention economy, the book still felt relaxing. I appreciated Odell's in-depth analysis of the danger of our dwindling attention spans; rather than simply encouraging a few anti-technology practices, she examines the importance of truly paying attention in all kinds of different ways. I particularly enjoyed <cite>How to Do Nothing</cite>'s emphasis on getting to know one's bioregion, and I'm eager to read more on that subject.
