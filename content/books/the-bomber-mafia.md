I enjoyed the way that this book told an interesting story while also raising a tricky moral dilemma. Although the main story takes a more violent route than the Bomber Mafia had envisioned, the book ends on a hopeful note; it's encouraging to know that technological advances are used to reduce civilian casualties in war. Next step: let's just not go to war at all because, as Gladwell notes, "all war is absurd."
