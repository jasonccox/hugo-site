This book was a fascinating mix of history, adventure, and mystery. I thought Preston did a great job interleaving his own story as part of the expedition to discover an ancient American city with historical context, and he piqued my interest in the pre-Columbian civilizations -- I'll certainly be looking for more books about the ancient Americas soon.

I also gained a new appreciation for archaeology from reading <cite>The Lost City of the Monkey God</cite>. The subject always seemed boring to me in the past, but now it seems like an interesting combination of solving mysteries, exploring the outdoors, and learning about history.
