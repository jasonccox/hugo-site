My son started watching the 2011 Disney Winnie the Pooh movie a year or so ago, and although neither my wife nor I grew up caring much about this classic stuffed bear, we both found it quite charming. I decided to read the book, and it was a fun, quick read. I'd love to read it to my kids at bedtime when they're old enough to pay attention despite the scarcity of pictures.
