This was a short but powerful book. I found that I kept wanting more and more of Morrie's wise advice, and I finished the whole book in less than 24 hours. (It helped that I had extra time because my kids were sick and slept lots.) I came away from the book touched by Morrie's goodness and inspired to be less self-absorbed and more willing to help others.
