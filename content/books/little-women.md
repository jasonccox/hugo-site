After re-watching the [2019 movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/) over the holidays, I decided to read <cite>Little Women</cite>. I enjoyed the way the book began as a carefree, humorous account of the girls' childhood and became more somber (although still amusing) as they grew up and experienced some of the hardships of life. Alcott skillfully composes many short stories into one cohesive narrative and teaches the reader that a truly happy life includes hard work, hard times, and especially love.
