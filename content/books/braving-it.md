Reading <cite>Braving It</cite> made me feel excited to spend more time outdoors. It also made me afraid of having teenage children of my own. ðŸ˜¬ Campbell does a good job telling the story of his and his daughter's Alaskan adventures, using enough detail to communicate the beauty and hardships of the wilderness without getting boring.
