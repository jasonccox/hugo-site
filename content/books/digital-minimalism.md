I've been working on finding ways to improve my relationship with technology, especially with my smartphone, for several months now, but I haven't had great success. I think this book may have changed that (although time will tell -- it's only been about a month since I started the book). Newport convincingly describes not just how to improve one's relationship with technology, but rather how to get technology out of the way and start living a more fulfilling life. I found his recommended digital declutter process quite effective, and the advice he gives for being a digital minimalist is so good that I'm considering buying a copy of the book for future reference.
