Wow, what a fascinating book! McBride artfully interleaves the story of his own childhood as a black boy in New York with the story of his white mother's upbringing in Virginia. The book includes many heavy topics -- abuse, racism, drugs, death -- but moves so quickly from one thing to the next that I never felt weighed down when reading it. In fact, I finished the book feeling both hopeful and in awe because of the enormous success that McBride's mother had in raising her children on hard work, faith, and love alone. <cite>The Color of Water</cite> was exactly what I was looking for -- a thought-provoking book about someone interesting but relatively unknown.
