I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Chris Knight's remarkable 27-year-long stay in the woods of Maine. In fact, this book made me want to escape from the world and go camping for a bit myself. I found the author's asides about the power of solitude and why some people seem to need far less social interaction than others particularly interesting, and I plan to read more about those topics soon. The end of the book was a bit anticlimactic and felt too abrupt to me, though.
