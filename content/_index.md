# Hi, I'm Jason!

I'm a software engineer, computer networking nerd, aspiring small business owner, and open source enthusiast. I don't care much for social media, so I've created this site instead as a place to share things with the world. I like to call it my little corner of the Internet.

## Site Overview

Here's the general layout of the site:

- [Creations](/creations): A list of things I've built (often software, but not always)

- [Blog](/blog): Stories, how-tos, and my thoughts on various topics

- [Resume](/resume): A summary of my professional and academic accomplishments

## Staying Updated

The best way to stay up-to-date with what I share on this site is to subscribe to the [RSS feed](/index.xml). If you're not sure how to do that, check out Wikipedia's large [list of RSS reader applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators) (although it's missing my personal favorite, [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/)).

## Getting in Touch

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [hi@jasoncarloscox.com](mailto:hi@jasoncarloscox.com). I'm happy to answer questions, take feedback, or simply discuss interesting topics. (I'm not interested in advertisements or offers to optimize my website, though, and I won't respond to such emails.)
